## **Projects:**

## **Multiplayer Game**
Developed a 2D real-time multiplayer fighting game using a combination
of Canvas, Node.js, Express.js, Socket.IO, and NGINX load balancing. Key
features include: Real-Time Multiplayer: Players connect in real-time to
compete in 2D combat, with seamless synchronization and lag reduction.

## **AI Parental Control Browser Extension**
Developed AI Parental Control, a Chrome extension that monitors, logs,
and restricts web browsing to enhance child safety online. It captures
YouTube and general browsing history by recording video titles, article
snippets, URLs, and timestamps, securely storing them in local storage.
The extension blocks inappropriate content by integrating external
blocklists (adult and gambling sites) and custom rules, refreshing
automatically every six hours. Implemented a responsive popup UI to
display recent activity and used Chrome‚Äôs Declarative Net Request API for
efficient blocking with minimal performance impact. Features include a
Parental Dashboard for intuitive activity monitoring and custom filtering,
and Real-Time Alerts notifying parents of restricted access attempts.

## **Intrusion Detection System with Snort, Google Cloud, and BigQuery**
This project involves the creation of an automated Intrusion Detection and
Alerting System that works in real-time. The system logs security-related
events, stores them in cloud storage (Google Cloud), and performs
analytics using BigQuery. Key components include: Snort: An open-source
network intrusion detection system that monitors network traffic. Realtime Alerts: Uses SMS and email alerts to notify users of suspicious
activity. Data Analytics: The logs and alerts are processed and stored in
Google Cloud, where BigQuery is used for SQL-based analysis and
reporting
