## **Projects:**

### **Intrusion Detection System with Snort, Google Cloud, and BigQuery**
This project involves the creation of an automated **Intrusion Detection and Alerting System** that works in real-time. The system logs security-related events, stores them in cloud storage (Google Cloud), and performs analytics using **BigQuery**. Key components include:
- **Snort**: An open-source network intrusion detection system that monitors network traffic.
- **Real-time Alerts**: Uses **SMS** and **email alerts** to notify users of suspicious activity.
- **Data Analytics**: The logs and alerts are processed and stored in Google Cloud, where **BigQuery** is used for SQL-based analysis and reporting.

This project is focused on creating a secure, scalable, and automated solution to monitor and react to network security events.

### **SkyBound Clash ‚Äî Multiplayer Game**
Developed a **2D real-time multiplayer fighting game** using a combination of **HTML5 Canvas**, **Node.js**, **Socket.IO**, and **NGINX load balancing**. Key features include:
- **Real-Time Multiplayer**: Players connect in real-time to compete in 2D combat, with seamless synchronization and lag reduction.
- **Matchmaking**: Automatically matches players based on their skill levels and region for optimal performance.
- **Client Prediction**: Reduces perceived lag by predicting the outcome of actions before the server responds, creating a smoother gameplay experience.
- **Environmental Hazards**: The game environment includes dynamic obstacles and hazards that affect gameplay.
- **Scalable Server Architecture**: Utilizes **NGINX** for load balancing to handle a large number of concurrent players efficiently.

This project showcases my ability to work on scalable server-side infrastructure and deliver an engaging gaming experience using real-time communication technologies.

### **NetNanny AI ‚Üí AI-powered Browser Extension for Child Safety**
The **NetNanny AI** is an intelligent **browser extension** that helps protect children from harmful online content. It blocks inappropriate websites and filters content based on real-time analysis. Features include:
- **Content Filtering**: Automatically blocks websites containing harmful or inappropriate content using AI-based algorithms.
- **Parental Dashboard**: Provides a user-friendly, intuitive interface for parents to monitor their children‚Äôs browsing activity and set personalized content filtering rules.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Sends notifications to parents whenever their child attempts to access a restricted website.
- **Compatibility**: Works across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) and integrates seamlessly with everyday browsing experiences.
- **Security & Privacy Focused**: Built with privacy in mind, the extension ensures no sensitive user data is stored or shared without consent.

This project demonstrates my ability to develop intelligent applications that prioritize user safety, combining **JavaScript**, **Node.js**, and **AI** algorithms to create an effective real-time filtering system.
